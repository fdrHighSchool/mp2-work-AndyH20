#### Respond to the following:

1. Write a plan for the following output:
```
000111222333444555666777888999
000111222333444555666777888999

```
  * Variable outside starting 0. 3 for loops in total, first loop will loop 3 times, making it go down a line after all the loops are done. Put the inner for. Inner loops 10 times, another loop inside making it loop 3 times. Inside loop prints number 3 times, then 1 is added everytime number is printed 3 times until it reaches 9. After all that, next line that repeats all the loops.


2. Write a plan for the following output:
```

  * Variable outside starting 9. 3 for loops in total, first loop will loop 5 times, making it go down a line after all the loops are done. Put the inner for. Inner loops 9 times, another loop inside making it loop 5 times. Inside loop prints number 5 times, then 1 is subtracted after 5 prints of the number until it reaches 1. After all that, next line that repeats all the loops.
